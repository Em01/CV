###About Me
I started to teach myself to code around a year ago using as many online resources, books and workshops that I could find. I enjoyed it so much that I made the decision to pursue this as a career. I gained a place at Makers Academy, a highly competitive and intensive 12 week web development course in London where I started at the end of March 2014. I was unable to afford the course fees so I launched a crowdfunding campaign with StudentFunder which enabled me to attend.

##Work

I have worked on various shows as a sound engineer both within the UK and abroad. I worked in this industry for over five years and due to the short running period of some shows I have not listed every show I have worked on but a sample is below. Responsibilities range from operating and mixing the show to looking after the microphones and delegating with performers backstage. I also studied full time for a degree throughout most of this period.
